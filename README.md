# 👋 Hi there, I'm Oluwademilade Adeniyi

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a **Data Analyst & Data Visualization Specialist** with a knack for turning raw data into clean, compelling stories. Whether it's through **Excel**, **Power BI**, or **SQL**, I love transforming messy datasets into sharp insights that drive clarity and action.

📊 From deep dives into data cleaning to building sleek dashboards, I bring an eye for design, a strong analytical mindset, and a passion for storytelling. I also create **synthetic datasets** from scratch when needed — because good analysis starts with good data, even if you have to build it yourself.

🔍 What I’m great at:
- Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- Insightful Dashboards & Reports  
- Data Storytelling  
- Business Problem Solving  
- Creating Realistic Synthetic Data  

💡 I enjoy exploring real-world questions and using data to answer them in ways that are smart, visual, and relatable. Every chart, every metric, every slice has a story — and I love telling it.
